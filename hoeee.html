            Joining ECE at IITG was very scary for me as quite a few people had told me that the
            course will be very exhausting and tough to tackle. The common electrical course in the first year
            confirmed that.
            I used to dread what would happen when there would be core department courses. However, at the far end of
            the fourth semester,
            I realize that these courses have helped me find an area of interest: Digital Systems Design.
            Gone are the days when the only two things between which I had to juggle my time were boards and JEE
            preparation.
            Being part of Techniche and multiple projects in clubs have taught me so much more than just how to manage
            time.
            It gave me the chance to meet some amazing professors and students. Overall, the last two years have been a
            memorable
            learning experience. I look forward to the next two years in this beautiful campus and whatever it has in
            store for me.

            My Caffeinated Journey
            <br>
            Well, it is nearly next to impossible to pen down in literature what an awesome journey
            I had till now, fingers crossed for the road untravelled, but none the less it is not what it
            teaches you but rather what you take out of the situations dangling in front of you.
            A flashback to my own past will reveal a lazy person waiting for the canvas to be filled on its own,
            but now thanks to IIT I am a completely changed person who is capable of transforming a canvas into a
            beautiful
            scenery with only a single colour. Some of the amazing moments I had till now is waking up the entire
            night to find pretty nasty bugs in my code and even to some extent in my life.
            It feels really awesome when you find some awesome gaping holes in some of the most famous consumer famous
            websites (P.S. - If I take a single name they will probably kill me, hahaha) and then get rewarded for your
            efforts. And this all possible because my mind is no longer bounded inside a box but rather the sky itself.
            Cheers to the upcoming journey :)

          <blockquote>Having lived the corporate life for nearly 3 years right after my graduation, I did understand
            that it was very hectic and monotonous.
            Obviously, every job demands a certain amount of time from us since we get paid, but it does not mean that
            we should lose ourselves in
            the humdrum of this life. By the time we realize that it becomes too hard to leave our routine and enjoy
            the true essence of life.
            I am the kind of person who wishes to explore and revel in the beauty of nature. So out of the busy
            schedule,
            I used to take out time to unwind and see new places, go on treks, do adventure sports, which I do even
            now.
            Travelling gives me happiness and maintains a balance in my life. I believe everyone has that “something”
            which gives them true contentment.
            I can recollect many things from my childhood days when I used to travel with my parents whenever there
            were vacations.
            My mom and I used to tag along with my father when he had some conferences out of the city.
            These memories and the zest to travel translated into my blog where I store my experiences and share it
            with the handful of readers.

            wished for and didn’t in some cases. But, even when I got what I wanted, I wasn’t content either. I
            realized that if you aren’t happy without it, you aren’t happy with it. But now, I’ve peace as I stopped
            comparing, I’ve joy as I do what I really love, and I am content as I’ve no regrets. And about success… I

            mistakes. I am a guy who loves living on edge and taking risks in life & mentioning one of them is that I
            decided to take humanities when I was in class 11 but luckily I didn’t and I am fortunate to those who
            convinced me not to put my steps in field of humanities. I love reading history and I can spend hours

            to keep the other one closed most of the time under my ongoing treatment. Once when in Delhi for an eye
            checkup, we were staying with a family friend, who played harmonium. I would sit near him and intently
            listen to him play and sing. That is how I came to love music. Music entered my life that day, when dad
            said, “My daughter would learn to sing”. Since I had to keep my eyes closed, my father would teach me by
            dictating the alphabets and tracing them with my fingers. It was the same with music; he would learn the
            basic notes from the teacher and then teach them to me. Only when I was in first standard did I realize
            what I was writing and then learnt to write on my own. From the time I was in fourth standard, I was
            leading the school choir and playing the harmonium in the assembly. When I was 12 years old, I participated
            in a national level singing competition held in Katra, J&K though it was for ages of 15 years and above. I
            cleared the auditions and made headlines that day.
